"subjects that touch upon current social, humanitarian, artistic and "
"scientific issues, which consist of two principles.</p><p>The two principles "
"seem to be unrelated and opposite to one another, but in reality they "
"complement each other and act jointly to achieve a harmonious unity.</"
"p><p>What are humans made of? Mind and body or just matter? How does the "
"wave&mdash;particle duality lead to the cutting-edge technology of quantum "
"computing? How do the parallel existence of electricity and magnetism and "
"their relationship as identified by Maxwell, lead to our modern economy and "
"society? How does digital dualism define our daily life? How does the "
"contrast between white and black compose the essence of a picture? How do "
"emptiness and fullness compose landscapes in architecture?</p><p>In all of "
"the above, the dependence relationship between the two principles is clear. "
"Without the existence of the first, the meaning of the other is negated.</"
