## Workflow

### Repository

The project uses the [Forking Workflow with Pull Requests](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request).

In short:
1. Fork the upstream repository and clone it to your local machine.
1. Follow the [installation instructions](installation.md).
1. Create a branch for the feature you want to work on.
1. When finished, push the feature branch to your repository.
1. Create a pull request on the [upstream repo](https://github.com/TEDxNTUA/tedxntua2020) and describe the changes you've made.
1. Participate in discussion between the team members on whether the feature needs improvements or should be merged.
1. Repeat!

For a more detailed guide on how to stay in sync with the upstream and avoid conflicts, read [this](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

### Development

English should be used for variable names, docstrings, documentation etc for uniformity.

Basic house rules:
1. [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliance.
1. Docstrings everywhere :)
1. Comply to the project's `.editorconfig` (download the plugin [here](https://editorconfig.org/#download)).
