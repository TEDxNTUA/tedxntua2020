            <p class="text-justify">
                The various activities of the students and the academic community in general in the National Technical University of Athens are proof of creativity endemic. This scientific potential is the fundamental material for the creation of progressive ideas, which are capable of following the current advancements in science and technology. Nonetheless, the massive immigration of young graduates towards the flourishing economies of the world, the appearance of numerous new fields, the need for highly specialized scientists and employees, the general sense of individualism and especially the pervasive economical and ethical crisis have deprived the academic community of the collaborative spirit necessary in every learning experience. TEDxNTUA is an organized effort to create and sustain the necessary frame for the exchange of new ideas in the fields of technology and business administration. At the same time, NTUAâ€™s community is becoming a living, extrovert organism focusing on the scientific and career goals of its members, while promoting the expansion of the network of collaboration between the NTUA, the industries and the startup community.
