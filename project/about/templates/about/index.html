            <h3>What is TEDxNTUA?</h3>
            <p>
                TEDxNTUA is a conference that features <strong>talks</strong> on
                the topics of <strong>popular science</strong>,
                <strong>art</strong>, and <strong>social issues</strong>,
                <strong>stories that can inspire</strong>, as well as
                <strong>intriguing workshops</strong> and
                <strong>performances</strong>. It runs under the auspices of the
                National Technical University of Athens, Greece
                (<a href="https://www.ntua.gr" target="_blank">NTUA</a>) and is
                primarily aimed at the university community, but also at the
                wider student and local communities of Athens.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our organizing team consists of
                <strong>volunteer students</strong>, mainly of NTUA, who embrace
                the notion of spreading worthy ideas, as conceived by the TED
                organization. Our aspiration as a team is to build this event
                into a platform where people who can make a difference will have
                their voices heard; where community members can engage with one
                another and spark fruitful discussion about our common concerns,
                like <strong>engineering</strong> and building
                <strong>a better and more inclusive society</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the projectâ€™s inception in <strong>2015</strong>, the
                members of the student community have consistently shown their
                support with their participation as attendees or volunteers.
                They have thus helped establish it as an institution and imbued
                us with a sense of duty towards them. A crucial part in
                achieving this, is our constant effort to make the event
                <strong>open for everyone</strong>, by charging no attendance
                fee, with the help of our partners.
            </p>

            <p>
                TEDxNTUA has a <strong>non-profit</strong> motive and is solely
                funded by sponsor companies, organizations and patrons. It is
                supervised by NTUA professors and formally belongs to the
                Institute of Communication and Computer Systems
                (<a href="https://www.iccs.gr" target="_blank">ICCS</a>) of
                NTUA.

                <p>
                    The organizing team is renewed each year. We are looking for
                    <strong>passionate students</strong> with an interest in
                    discovering people and ideas that need to be heard, building
                    the overall experience of the event, collaborating with
                    partners to fund the project, creating amazing graphic
                    designs, identifying the ideal venue for the event, using
                    the social media to tell compelling stories and promote the
                    cause, or developing attractive websites and apps for our
                    event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team works together for months to deliver a
                    <strong>unique experience</strong>, through a journey that,
                    although demanding, is truly <strong>bonding</strong> and
                    <strong>gratifying</strong> in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can join us as a <strong>volunteer for
                    the day of the event</strong> when greater assistance is
                    needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Applications open around September for the organizing team
                    and 4-6 weeks before the event for the event-day volunteers.
                    <strong>Stay tuned</strong> to our social media pages to be
                    updated.

                        less. Many of these talks are then made available, free,
                        at <a href="https://www.ted.com" target="_blank">TED.com</a>.

                    <p>
                        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
                        <strong>local, self-organized events</strong> that bring
                        people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx
                        event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark
                        <strong>deep discussion and connection</strong>. These
                        local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where
                        <em>x = independently organized TED event</em>.

                        The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx
                        program, but individual TEDx event are self-organized.
